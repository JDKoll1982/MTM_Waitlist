# Specification Quality Checklist: Generic Work Center — Designation and Request Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate Companion specification completeness before planning
**Created**: 2026-11-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are genuine ambiguities (≤3) deferred to clarify — not unresolved guesses
- [x] Each Functional Requirement is a single, testable MUST/SHOULD statement
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into the specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before clarify or plan
- The specification was authored on 2026-10-29 as chunk 2 of the eight-chunk split recorded in `specs/015-generic-wc-ui-shell/BREAKDOWN.md`. This pass re-checked it against the list above and found no gap, so the text is unchanged.
- `Verbatim Constraints` is absent because the request pinned no literal identifier or string.
